/// Generates the detached `/bin/sh` script that performs VPN Switch's
/// self-replacing update swap, and the shell-quoting helper that makes doing
/// so safe.
///
/// THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CODE IN THE PROJECT. The generated script ends
/// with `rm -rf "$INSTALL_DIR/$BUNDLE_NAME"` against a path built from
/// filesystem/bundle strings that this app does not fully control (a
/// build-directory path, a Finder-renamed `.app`, etc.). An unquoted space,
/// quote character, or shell metacharacter in any interpolated value can
/// corrupt that `rm -rf` into deleting the wrong thing, or worse. Every
/// value that flows into the generated script MUST go through `shQuote(_:)`
/// first — there is no other line of defense once the script is launched:
/// by the time it runs, the app that could have caught a mistake has already
/// called `NSApp.terminate(nil)`. Note the installed bundle name is
/// `"VPN Switch.app"` — it contains a space, which is exactly why `shQuote`
/// is what makes interpolating it into shell text safe in the first place.
///
/// A running `.app` cannot overwrite its own bundle out from under itself,
/// so the swap has to happen from a process that outlives it: this type only
/// produces the *text* of that script. Writing it to disk, making it
/// executable, launching it detached, and calling `NSApp.terminate(nil)`
/// afterward are all done elsewhere (in the code that owns `NSApp`) — kept
/// here only because this logic is pure string generation with no AppKit
/// dependency, and pure string generation is exactly what can be
/// unit-tested exhaustively without ever touching a filesystem or process.

    ///   - dmgPath: absolute filesystem path to the already-downloaded AND
    ///     VERIFIED DMG (see `UpdateInstaller.verify` — this script must
    ///     never run against an unverified artifact).
    ///   - parentPID: the running app's own `getpid()`, so the script can
    ///     wait for this specific process to exit before touching anything.
    ///   - installDir: the directory CONTAINING the installed bundle (i.e.
    ///     `Bundle.main.bundleURL.deletingLastPathComponent().path`) — NOT
    ///     hardcoded to `/Applications`, so this works from a build
    ///     directory too.
    ///   - bundleName: the bundle's own last path component (e.g.
    ///     `"VPN Switch.app"`), taken from `Bundle.main.bundleURL`.
    ///   - relaunch: whether the script's final step should `open` the
    ///     freshly-swapped bundle. Defaults to `true` (the real production
    ///     path). Only the LIVE integration test passes `false`, so it can
    ///     run the real end-to-end swap against a throwaway, non-launchable
    ///     test fixture without spawning a fake "app" process as a side
    ///     effect of the test.
    ///
    /// Every one of the four string values is interpolated through
    /// `shQuote(_:)` exactly once. The script:
    ///   1. Spins on `kill -0 "$PID"` (once per 0.5s) until the parent
    ///      process has actually exited, so the running `.app` bundle is
    ///      never touched while still in use.
    ///   2. `hdiutil attach -nobrowse -noverify -plist` the DMG, capturing
    ///      its plist output to a temp file.
    ///   3. Parses the mount point out of that plist with `python3` (never
    ///      by grepping `/Volumes` — fragile and ambiguous with concurrent
    ///      mounts). If `python3` is unavailable, or parsing fails to
    ///      produce a mount point, the script logs and exits NONZERO
    ///      *before* doing anything destructive — it never falls back to
    ///      guessing a path.
    ///   4. Refuses to proceed if the installed bundle
    ///      (`"$INSTALL_DIR/$BUNDLE_NAME"`) does not already exist as a
    ///      directory — guards against a wrong `installDir` turning the
    ///      next step into a no-op `rm -rf` of the wrong place followed by
    ///      installing into a location nothing will ever launch from.
    ///   5. `rm -rf` the OLD installed bundle
    ///      (`"$INSTALL_DIR/$BUNDLE_NAME"`) — the single irreversible step
    ///      in this entire pipeline.
    ///   6. `cp -R` the new bundle from the mounted DMG into `installDir` in
    ///      its place — same path, same signing identity, so TCC/login-item/
    ///      keychain-ACL grants survive (do not change this to a "fresh
    ///      install" elsewhere).
    ///   7. `hdiutil detach` the mounted volume.
    ///   8. `open` the freshly-installed bundle — unless `relaunch` is
    ///      `false`, in which case this step is skipped and a log line is
    ///      emitted in its place.
    ///
    /// Every step from `hdiutil attach` onward is written with `set -e`
    /// semantics made explicit (`|| exit 1` after the load-bearing steps)
    /// so a failure partway through stops rather than silently continuing
    /// into the next (potentially destructive) step. All output is expected
    /// to be redirected to a log file by the CALLER (via `nohup ... >>
    /// /tmp/vpn-switch-update.log 2>&1 &` or similar), not by this script
    /// itself — this script just writes to stdout/stderr as normal.
